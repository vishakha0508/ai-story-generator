# AI Story Generator

This project generates creative stories based on user prompts using OpenAI's GPT-3.5.

## How to Use
1. Run the backend using Flask.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. Enter a prompt and click "Generate Story" to see the story.

## Current Limitation

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask server:
